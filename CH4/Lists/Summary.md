# 4.Lists, Stacks, and Queues 
- **DEF'N**: finite, ordered sequence of data items known as "elements"
- Position : List must have a position(ordered) / analogous to the mathematical concept of 'sequence'

## 4.1.1 Array-based list implementation
- Array-based List
  - It actually uses [] operator from c array, so traversing over the elements is easy
  - Just looking apparently, cannot find out any difference with c++ vector(maybe there will be differnece when inserting an element)

## 4.1.2 Linked List
  - Linked list is made up of a series of objects called the nodes(node is a distinct object opposed to a cell in an array)
  - Basically, considering encapsulation, node should be the private member of the linked list
  - **For operations such as insert, linked list shows better performance due to the node**
  - **However, operations like prev or current position is much less efficient**
